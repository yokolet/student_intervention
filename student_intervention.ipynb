    "    In the article, k-NN was applied to classify new automobile prototypes. A manufacturer wants to know what exisiting vehicles are close to currenlty develping new prototypes mostly for a marketing purpose. After finding nearest neighbors (similar type of vehicles), the manufacturer can learn what feature of the prototype is better than similar ones, which will be a good source of marketing. Like this example, k-NN can be applied to find the best group which the new data should belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths<br/>\n",
    "    Since k-NN is an instance based learning, there's no cost of training. The data will be categoraized instantly. Its simple algorithm is also a strength.

The curse of dimensionality is another problem to make computational time worse. Even though the data size is not huge, as a number of features goes bigger, it needs to calculate many distances. Also, as the number of features grows, the number of irrelevant features may grow. To use k-NN, it would be good to eliminate such irrelevant features.\n",

    "- Why this model<br/>\n",
    "    Teachers want to identify what groups of students tend to fail. From given dataset, it's possible to find that a new student is the closest to what groups based on similarity. If the similar students tend to fail, teachers can conclude the new student has a great possiblity to fail. Our test data doesn't have huge samples and features. k-NN won't cause any computational problem.\n",

    "    This article discusses how SVM was applied to predict a person would have diabetes/pre-diabetes. People's medical records are parametrized and used as data set. SVM is a classifier to make margin wide as much as possible. The result, whether the person will have diabetes or not, shows SVM predicts well without any prior knowlege of data distribution. The healthcare is one of many other ares SVM can be applied. It is often said SVM is good in image processing area. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths<br/>\n",
    "    The idea of SVM is to maximize the margin between decision boundary and closest data. For computation, only data close to the boundary (support vectors) are influential. Because of this, outliers doesn't bother SVM. During the margin maximization, SVM uses a regularizarion parameter. This has an effect to generalize the result and helps avoiding overfitting. Another strength is that the decision boundary on hyperplane can be linear or non-linear by SVM's kernel trick. Since the boundary will be formed on hyperplane, even though number of features gets big, SVM works effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses<br/>\n",
    "    When the linear boundry doesn't work, figuring out what kernel fits best would be a hard problem. This requires domain knowledge. In addition to choosing the best kernal, choosing the good parameters is another problem. Depending the parameters given, the result may overfit. Other than choosing good ones, as number of features grows in nonlinear kernel, computation will go expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why this model<br/>\n",
    "    The dataset may not be linealy separable into two categories, whether the groups of students tend to fail or not. In such a case, SVM will create a complex but effective decition boundary. The prediction accurary is expected to be high. The given dataset is not big, so the time for training won't be long.\n",

The result shows this binary classifier worked well for this kind of lineary separable dataset.

    "    Logistic Regression is a simple algorithm and works well when given dataset can be linearly separable (only one decision boundary exists). The training is fast because of its simple algorithm. Like SVM, it also uses a regularization parameter which keeps the model from overfitting. Logistic Regression training is to find better parameters to form a better decision boundary. The parameters are independent from other features, so the caclulation can be done in parallel for each feature. This means the model doesn't have a problem of curse of diminsionality in terms of computational cost.\n",

If the model is complex and needs more than one decision boundaries, other classifier such as SVM would be the choice. Unlike SVM, Logistic Regression uses all training data equally. When irrelevant features come in, those will give unwated effects on the parameter calculation. In such a case, the prediction will get worse. Not just irrelevant features, outliers are the problam of Logis tic Regression since it tries to maximize likelihood using all training data.\n",

Each table shows how fast the training and prediction are, and how accurate the resutls are for both taining and test data. F1 Score ranges between 0 and 1.0. The best F1 Score is 1.0. If we add up Training Time and Prediction Time in test, Logistic Regression is the fastest. Logistic Regression has the best F1 Score, 0.8060, in test with 300 training set size. Logistic Regression looks a good choice. However, F1 Score in training goes down as the training size increases. If the model fits well, the accuracy for taining data should get better as the training size increases. Since the result was opposite, Logistic Regression may not be a good model for the data.\n",

The prediction accuracies are similar, but SVM has better values overall. As training data size increases, the F1 Score of test data increases. The F1 Score of training data doesn't have an apparent increasing tendency, but at least, it doesn't decrease.\n",

    "Why Support Vector Machine (SVM) is expected to work well? There are two main reasons this algorithm would predict accurately. One is how a decision boundary is determined. The decision boundary devides training data in to two groups. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume only two features are involved in. This means training data can be plotted on a 2 demensional plane with labels (star or circle) as in the picture below. Also, for the sake of simplicity, let's assume training data can be devided by a straight line. To find the best line to devide training data in two groups, SVM tries to maximize the distances of the closest data points on the both side. The distance is called a margin. The closest data points are called support vectors. SVM's training goes like this: finds the closest pairs of star and circle, calculates the distances of each pair, draws a line that cuts throgh the middle of the each pair. The line should devide star and circle groups well since the line is on the farthest location to both groups. When test data are given, SVM checks the new data is on which side of the line. Lastly, SVM gives a label to each test data. This is a predicition.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Margin of Support Vector Machine](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SVM_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is how SVM solves a complex problem created by more than two deminsions and many features. In the real world data, a number of features are often more than two. When more than two features are involved in, the line will turn to a hyperplane. This is because features are expressed by multi-dimension data. SVM doesn't have any problem to form the hyperplane from support vectors which are multi-dimension data. In addition, the hyperplane, in another word, a decision boundary, should have a more complex shape rather than flat plane to devide groups. SVM has a nice feature called a kernel trick. Look at the picture blow. The picture shows an ellipse shaped decision boundary. In this case, a line never works as a decision boundary. The ellipse has a smooth line/surfece; however, a bumpy surface may work for some dataset. SVM still works well even in such a case becuase of the kernel trick. The shape of decision boundary is called a kernel. SVM has an ability to manage a complex kernel. Our data may or may not be separable by the straight line or plane. Whatever the shape of decision boundary is, SVM is expected to work well.\n",
